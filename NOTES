When creating structs to represent responses, prefer Option<Box<T>> instead of Option<T>
when sizeof T > 8, as Option<T> is 8 bytes, and only allocates if needed

((((
    IPC Options:
    - Shared Memory:
        + Very fast
        - Potentially unsafe, world visible
        - Need to account for racing conditions
    - Message Passing:
        + Simple
        + No sync required
        - Slower
        - Higher resource consumption

Just use iceoryx2 cuh
WARNING: DO NOT USE HEAP OR STATIC MEMORY AS IT IS NOT SHARED, CREATE SPECIAL STRUCT FOR IPC SENDING/RECEIVING
- No Vec, use [T; N]
- No String or &str, only [{char,u8}; N]
- Don't use Boxes
- No pointer logic whatsoever
