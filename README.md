### Why ?
I'm mostly making this out of curiosity...
Also because I think electron-based webapps are spawns of the devil and should be replaced

As for the name, the rendering library is called Xilem, so I just chose a vascular plant's name

### How ?
First and foremost, wrappers need to be created around Discord's API, a lot of it is not officially documented, some digging is needed.
After those are done, create UI elements and link them to the wrapper.

In the future, add wrappers around the app so that scripts and whatnot can expand its behaviour.
